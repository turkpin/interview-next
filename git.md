## Commit Message

A "commit" is a change in the codebase. Every commit has a message that explains what and why the changes were made.

### Glossary

- `type`: specifies the category of the change, indicating its purpose
  - `amend`: an additional (forgotten) change to the previous (pushed) commit
  - `build`: changes affecting the build system (e.g., Webpack, Docker, CI/CD scripts)
  - `chore`: routine tasks like config updates, dependency bumps, etc.
  - `ci`: changes to CI/CD configuration and pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis)
  - `deps`: dependency updates or removals
  - `docs`: documentation changes (README, inline docs, etc.)
  - `env`: environment configuration changes
  - `feat`: introduces new behavior or expands existing capabilities
  - `fix`: corrects unintended or incorrect behavior
  - `hotfix`: emergency fix deployed quickly (usually a subtype of fix)
  - `init`: initial commit or project setup
  - `perf`: changes that improve performance
  - `refactor`: changes structure without altering behavior or contracts
  - `revert`: reverts a previous commit
  - `security`: patches or upgrades related to security
  - `style`: code style changes (formatting, linting, no logic change)
  - `test`: adding or updating tests
  - `ui`: user interface changes (visual updates, styling)
  - `ux`: user experience improvements (non-functional but noticeable to users)
- `scope`: provides additional context or the location of the change (e.g., file, folder, resource, module, api, ui, etc.)
- `description`: brief summary of the change

### Format

```
(type) scope: description
```

```
(type) description
```

and maybe

```
scope: description
```

The `type` and `scope` are used to categorize the change; the `description` explains it.
